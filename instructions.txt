Movie Recommendation Engine: Usage Guide

Prerequisites
-------------
- You need a Unix environment (Linux/Mac or Windows with WSL).
- Ensure that awk, grep, and column utilities are installed (available on almost all Unix systems).

Setup
-----
1. Place BOTH movies.sh and movies.csv in the same directory.
2. Give execute permission to movies.sh:
   chmod +x movies.sh

Running the Script
------------------
You can filter the movie list using any combination of the following options:

  --genre GENRE             # Filter by genre (case-insensitive)
  --min-rating RATING       # Filter by minimum star rating
  --year START-END          # Filter by year range (e.g., 2000-2010)
  --director NAME           # Filter by director (case-insensitive)

Examples:
---------
- All Sci-Fi movies by Christopher Nolan with rating >= 8.5, from 2000-2020:
    ./movies.sh --genre "Sci-Fi" --director "Christopher Nolan" --min-rating 8.5 --year 2000-2020

- All movies from 1995-2000 with a rating at least 9.0:
    ./movies.sh --year 1995-2000 --min-rating 9

- All Drama movies:
    ./movies.sh --genre Drama

- All movies directed by Tarantino:
    ./movies.sh --director Tarantino

Tips:
-----
- All filters can be used in any order or combination.
- Results are shown in a column-aligned table.
- If you just run ./movies.sh with no arguments, you’ll see usage/help.

This engine works entirely offline and does not require any API or internet access.
