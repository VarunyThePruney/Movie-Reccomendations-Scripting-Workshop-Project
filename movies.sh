#.id is id of film, .title is the title of the film
#.genres is the generes, | map(.name) pipes the genres names, | join("/") joines the names with a slash in case of multiple genres.
#.vote average is the ratings for the film
#release date is formatted as (yyyy/mm/dd), split("-") turns it into an array["yyyy", "mm", "dd"]. [0] takes the first element of the array which is year
#.credits.crew pulls the crew that worked on the film, | mape(select(.job=="Director") | .name pulls the director name(s), lastly | join("/") joins the director(s) together with a "/"\
#finally | @csv formats it into a csv file and places it in output with >> s
